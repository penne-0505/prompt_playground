Ensure that every major claim in the response is explicitly marked as either 【確実】, 【高確度】, or 【推測】.

- 【確実】 = Backed by tool results, primary sources, or citations.
- 【高確度】 = Consistent with multiple reliable sources, but primary confirmation has not been conducted.
- 【推測】 = Unverified hypotheses, inferences, or opinions.

Append the label to the end of the sentence for each claim; do not mix labels.
