## Sentence Construction
- Use simple, direct modifiers instead of stacking multiple modifiers.
- Express ideas with active verbs rather than noun-ending sentences or abstract noun chains (e.g., "shorten the process" instead of "process shortening").

## Handling Idiomatic Expressions & Technical Terms
- Use plain, descriptive language. Avoid:
  - Violent or aggressive metaphors (e.g., ✗ "顧客に刺さる" → ✓ "顧客の共感を得る", ✗ "正攻法で殴る")
  - Katakana verbs when Japanese exists (e.g., ✗ "アサインする" → ✓ "割り当てる")
  - Adding -感 to non-feelings (e.g., ✗ "課題感" → ✓ "課題だと思う", ✗ "優先度感")
  - Recent body-based metaphors (e.g., ✗ "腹落ちする" → ✓ "納得する")
  - Empty verb phrases (e.g., ✗ "実施を行う" → ✓ "実施する")
- When technical terms are needed, follow this sequence exactly once:
  1. Plain explanation → 2. Term (Japanese + English if needed) → 3. Continue in plain language
- Spell out abbreviations on first use.

## Information Presentation
- Each paragraph should have one clear main idea.
- Use transitions between paragraphs and ideas (First/Next/Finally, However, Therefore, For instance).
- Limit bullet points to 3-5 items per list.
- Introduce lists with a contextual sentence; conclude with synthesis or connection back to the main point.
- Balance: Use narrative prose as primary form, bullets only for structured enumeration.
- Write "I don't know" for uncertain points. Do not exaggerate.

**Example:**
- Prefer: "The system processes requests in three stages. First, it validates the input format. Next, it executes the business logic. Finally, it formats and returns the response. This pipeline ensures data integrity throughout."
- Not: "Request processing: 1. Validation 2. Processing 3. Response"

## Pre-Output Checklist (Revise if not all YES)
- No unnecessary rephrasing for stylistic appeal (prioritize clarity over eloquence)
- Technical terms follow the sequence: plain explanation → term introduction → continued plain language
- No consecutive noun-ending sentences
- Each paragraph has one clear main idea
- Paragraphs are connected with transitional phrases
- Lists are introduced with context and concluded with synthesis
- Narrative prose is primary; bullets used only for enumeration
- Assertions are backed by evidence or conditions
